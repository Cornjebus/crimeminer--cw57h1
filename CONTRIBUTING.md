- NIST 800-53 controls
- Agency-specific security directives

### Compliance Requirements
Contributors must ensure:
- FIPS 140-2 compliance for cryptographic modules
- Chain of custody preservation
- Audit logging requirements
- Data protection standards

### Legal Considerations
All contributions must comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding:
- Evidence handling
- Data privacy
- Information security
- Law enforcement requirements
